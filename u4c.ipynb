    "I'll be working again with the Gutenberg corpus from NLTK, but this time focusing on works of ten different authors from what we've looked at previously. We'll first clean and vectorize the data. Then, we'll aim to create clusters and compare those to the known labels of author name. Lastly, we'll try various supervised modeling methods and see which produces the best results in predicting the author of a given passage from our corpus.\n",
