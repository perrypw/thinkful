    "I'll be working again with the Gutenberg corpus from NLTK, but this time focusing on works of ten different authors from what we've looked at previously. We'll first clean and vectorize the data. Then, we'll aim to create clusters and compare those to the known labels of author name. Lastly, we'll try various supervised modeling methods and see which produces the best results in predicting the author of a given passage from our corpus.\n",

    "    - K means and spectral clustering produced the most interpretable results.\n",
    "    - Using lemmas instead of word tokens arguably made the clusters a bit easier to understand to the naked eye.\n",
    "- Supervised models had a much more useful application to the question of grouping passages by authors, and we were able to produce several fairly accurate models.\n",
    "- Our most accurate model on the test set was an L2 logistic regression based on the tfidf vectorization (without LSA) on paragraphs longer than 5 words, which was further grid-search optimized.\n",
    "    - In general, expanding to tfidf instead of using LSA improved performance, particularly for this logistic regression model.\n",
    "    - Excluding short paragraphs also helped improve the accuracy and applicability of our models, as the most common real world application would likely involve predicting the author based on a passage of at least a few words.\n",
    "    - Word2vec showed promise as a technique, but for better results we'd want to bring in a pretrained model informed by a much larger corpus.\n",
    "    - Stemming tokens showed limited impact on predictive value in our application."
