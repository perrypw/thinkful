    "We'll start with the Amazon data and use that to train a naive bayes model for predicting sentiment. The first step is to define which keywords would indicate a positive or negative review. My initial approach was to create lists of terms that I thought would be positive or negative, but I eventually settled on a more programmatic approach. Let's split the data into those with a negative review and those with a positive. Then, let's calculate the most common words in each of those datasets. Next, remove any duplicates, since these are likely common words like \"the\", or will be indeterminate in whether they indicate a good or bad review. We'll feed these into the model and see how we do."
