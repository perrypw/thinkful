    "# Regression vs Classification Drill\n",
    "1) The amount a person will spend on a given site in the next 24 months\n",
    "    - Continuous\n",
    "2) What color car someone is going to buy\n",
    "    - Classification (the outcome is categorical)\n",
    "3) How many children a family will have\n",
    "    - This could be done either way and depends on the context of the question. I would lean towards classification since the possible values are discrete and limited to a range from, say, zero to five for most people.\n",
    "4) If someone will sign up for a service\n",
    "    - Classification\n",
    "5) The number of times someone will get sick in a year\n",
    "    - Like the children example, this could be either for the same reasons. With this one though, I would go with continuous since there is a wider range of possible values\n",
    "6) The probability someone will get sick in the next month\n",
    "    - Classification\n",
    "7) Which medicine will work best for a given patient\n",
