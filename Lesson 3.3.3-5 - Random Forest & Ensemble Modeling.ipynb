    "# Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "What if instead of making one decision tree you made several. As many as you wanted, really. A whole forest. Then each tree in the forest got a vote on the outcome for a given observation. Then you'd have a new model type: **Random Forest**. Random forests have become an incredibly popular technique for data scientists because it tends to be a top performer in a huge number of circumstances, with low variance and high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like Decision Trees, Random Forest can be used for both classification and regression problems. The main difference is how the votes are aggregated. As a classifier the most popular outcome (the mode) is returned. As a regression it is typically the average or mean that is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a Random Forest you get to set parameters for both the tree and the forest. So for the tree you have the same parameters as before: you can set the depth of the tree and the number of features used in each rule or split. You can also specify how the tree is built, with using information gain and entropy like we did before, or other methods like [Gini impurity](https://www.garysieling.com/blog/sklearn-gini-vs-entropy-criteria).\n",
    "\n",
    "You also get to control the number of estimators you want to generate, or the number of trees in the forest. Here you have a tradeoff between how much variance you can explain and the computational complexity. This is pretty easily tuneable. As you increase the number of trees in the forest the accuracy should converge as eventually the additional learning from another tree approaches zero. There isn't an infinite amount of information to learn, and at some point the trees have learned all they can. So when you have acceptable variance in accuracy you can stop adding trees. This becomes worthwhile when you're dealing with large datasets with many variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bagging and Random Subspace\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, Random Forest models don't just create a ton of trees using the same data again and again and again. Instead they use bagging and random subspace to generate trees that are different. Without this, the trees could be incredibly similar (even identical), leading to correlation between trees and vulnerability to bias in the trees from some highly predictive features dominating every tree, creating a series of very similar trees with very similar, and potentially biased, predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, Random Forests use **bagging**. Each tree selects a subset of observations with replacement to build the training set. Replacement here means it can simply choose the same observation multiple times, which is only really a problem when there are few observations. It puts the observation \"back in the bag\", if you will, where it can be pulled and chosen again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests also typically use a random subset of features for each split. This means for each time it has to perform a split or generate a rule, it is only looking at the **random subspace** created by a random subset of _some_ of the features as possibilities to generate that rule. This will help avoid the aforementioned correlation problem because the trees will not be built with the same available features at every point. As a general rule, for a dataset with x features $\\sqrt{x}$ features are used for classifiers and $x/3$ for regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages/Disadvantages to Random Forest\n",
    "Advantages\n",
    "- Strong performer in wide variety of situations\n",
    "- Regression and classification possible\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages\n",
    "- Can only output for predictions values which it has seen before from the training data\n",
    "- Can be slow and cumbersome if it gets too big\n",
    "- \"Black box\" complaint - you don't really know what's going on in the model and can't pinpoint its mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ensemble modeling\n",
    "Random forest is an example of an ensemble model, which is a larger topic. An ensemble model is a model that is produced by, or made up of, other models. They build on simpler models into something that is usually more complex and therefore accurate. Though there are really infinite types of \"ensemble\" models, most fall into 3 categories:\n",
    "- __Bagging:__ When you take subsets of data and train a model on each of the subsets, which then simultaneously vote on the outcome. The final output is then the majority or mean result.\n",
    "- __Boosting:__ As opposed to building models simultaneously like bagging, boosting takes the output of one model as the input into the next in a form of *serial processing*. They then get chained together until the stopping condition is met (we'll cover this later).\n",
    "- __Stacking:__ Stacking combines bagging and boosting by in phase one running a bagging exercise with simultaneous models, and then using those in phase two in a serial fashion.\n",
    "- You can manually create ensemble models based on your own discretion as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages/Disadvantages to Ensemble Modeling\n",
    "There are advantages and disadvantages to ensemble models. Most notable is of course their performance. Ensemble models are often some of the most accurate techniques to apply to a problem. They also tend to have low variance because they're built from multiple internal models.\n",
    "\n",
    "However there are also downsides. Most notably, some ensemble techniques, particularly boosting, are prone to overfitting. You also lose a lot of the transparency that individual models offer. You saw this clearly in the Random Forest example, where the easy explanations offered by decision trees are abstracted away by the forest.\n",
